# abc ( Another basic calculator)
## Description
I created ABC Calculator by combining the best features 
of qalc and bc, making it significantly more 
user-friendly. Instead of being restricted to 
using +, -, *, /, which often require pressing the 
shift key, my calculator uses intuitive QWERTY keys:

a for add

s for subtract

m for multiply

d for divide

e for exponentiate

Additionally, h displays the help menu, and q quits the application. This design streamlines input, making calculations faster and more efficient for IT professionals and other users.
